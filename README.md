This project will be using javascript to create a puzzle game named "FIZZ-BUZZ" in which the user inputs a number and the output shows the numbers starting from 1 to the input number by user .

The numbers are replaced by words fizz or buzz basedd on their divisibility with 3 or 5 or both.

If a number is divisible by 3 only then it gets replaced with "fizz", if it is divisible by 5 it gets replaced by "buzz".

And if it is divisible by both then it gets replacd by "fizzbuzz".
